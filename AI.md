## Guidelines relevant to AI-assisted contributions

Tools using AI are increasingly used to produce text and code, but verifying the
quality of such output can be difficult.  We ask you, the contributor, to be
willing to adapt your workflow accordingly.  The guidelines also apply, or have
a direct counterpart, with entirely human-produced content.

1. We strive to evaluate contributions based on their merit, not their authors.

2. We ask that you have either written, or read and reviewed yourself,
   *every part* of your contribution.  You are responsible for its quality.
   (It is strongly recommended that you read a proposed contribution in full
   even if you wrote all of it.)  In some circumstances, for example joint
   work, it may be appropriate to delegate review: please state that on the PR.

3. Reviewing AI-produced code can require a different approach from
   human-written code.  If a significant portion of your code, PR description,
   review comments or messages has been AI-generated, please disclose this,
   stating which tool was used and for what.  You should have an acknowledgement
   anyway even if another *human* contributor did some of the work.

4. Please be mindful that reviewer time is a scarce resource. Contributions
   (whether human- or AI-authored) should strive to conserve it.

5. You should not submit code, however it was written, unless you have absolute
   confidence in its provenance. (We believe the current position of authors of
   AI coding agents is that it is the user's responsibility to ensure the output
   does not infringe copyright or licensing terms.) You will need to sign the
   OCaml contributor licence agreement (CLA) for any significant contribution.

6. The following are never acceptable as contributions: low-effort productions
   of code that contributors do not understand; plagiarised works; hallucinated
   security reports; or experiments involving humans without their advance
   consent.
